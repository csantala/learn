LEARN 1.0 Copyright 2013-2014 by Chris Santala

This is an experiment to aid the human learning process through the breakdown of an object into multiple steps with student/teacher interaction available at each step.  The system allows for an assignment to be created and then completed by students with their progress available at the assignment dashboard.  As this is a hashed based system, user accounts are not required.
